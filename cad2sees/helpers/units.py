Unit system definitions for CAD2Sees.

This module defines a consistent unit system based on kN-m-sec for
structural analysis calculations. All units are defined relative to
the base units: kilonewton (kN), metre (m), and second (sec).

Base Units:
    Force: kN (kilonewton)
    Length: m (metre)
    Time: sec (second)

Derived Units:
    Stress: MPa (megapascal)
    Acceleration: m/secÂ²
